# About

This is an example of using the Spark-ml library to solve the [Titanic challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

I obtained a public score of `0.79426` on Kaggle with the current setup.

## Using Zeppelin

You can start Zeppelin with docker-compose to explore the data with a `titanic` notebook already created.

    docker-compose up -d
